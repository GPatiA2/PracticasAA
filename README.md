# Practicas Aprendizaje Automático

This repository contains the projects done during the subject "Aprendizaje Automático y Big Data" which I took during my third year studying at UCM.

## Practica 0 :

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook which we used to show the efficiency difference between scalar and vectorized operations using Numpy.

## Practica 1 :

In this folder, you can find a jupyter notebook in which we try to predict the price of a flat given features like the amount of surface it have, or the number of beedrooms 
it has using Linear Regression.

## Practica 2 :

This project consists of a jupyter notebook we made to try to predict if a student was going to be admited by a certaing institution given their grade of an exam using Logistic 
Regression and learned about de effects of L2 regularization.

## Practica 3 :

In this project we learned about Neural Networks and multiclass logistic regression aplying it to the MINIST dataset.

## Practica 4 :

This project consists of an implementation of a Neural Network from scratch using the forward and backward propagation algorithms.

## Practica 5 : 

The main objective of this project was to implement regularized linear regression and learn about the effects of overfitting and underfitting.

## Practica 6 :

In this project we learned about tokenizing a text and applied that knowledge to create a Spam filter

## Proyecto :

This project was the final assignment for the subject. We had to choose a Kaggle dataset and use Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and SVMs to classify it.
We chose a dataset consisting of data taken from sensors plugged into a person while doing 4 different movements (rock, paper, scisors, okay) and our goal was to 
guess which move the person made given the values taken from the sensors.
